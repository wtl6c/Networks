        Create a packet containing DV cost information. Source is not required
        when creating a packet as that will automatically be filled in by the
        simulator.

        Arguments:
        - `destination`: The entity index of the recipient node.
        - `costs`:       An array with a length equivalent to the number of
                         entities in the network. Each value in the array should
                         be the cost from the sender to the entity with that
                         index.
